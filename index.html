        <p class="card-text">Hello, my name is Ogu Mary-Precious Nzubechi. i am a Product Designer, growing, learning and designing everyday. I am <span class="that">the creative Designer</span> that brings ideas back to live.</p>
    <P class="card-text">I have been designing for a year and six months now. In my few months of designing, i can say one thing i am very grateful for, is the ability to grw and learn. Being a Product Designer hasn't been easy, but it is a profession i enjoy, a work i love doing, even in my dreams!</p>
        <p class="card-text">My first experience with Product Design was like getting the calm feeling that comes with being embraced. It might sound too out of speech, but Design, has made alot of impact in my lfe, my thoughts and my general self. It's like having a clear view of the world through a scope.</p>
